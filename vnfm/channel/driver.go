/*
Package channel abstract the transport channel between an OpenBaton VNFM and the NFVO.

See go-dummy-vnfm for a sample implementation of a VNFM using the AMQP driver.

vnfm uses the vnfm/channel package to abstract the underlying transport channel.
The required drivers must be registered before creating a new VNFM using vnfm.Register(); usually, this is done automatically by the driver package when first imported.

	// import the driver
	import _ "driver/package/xyz"

	//  some code here

	// "xyz" is the identifier of the desired driver.
	svc, err := vnfm.New("xyz", handler, cfg)
	// use the svc
